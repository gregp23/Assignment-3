    <h1>Data Structures that was used?</h1>
    <p>In this project I used a LinkedHashMap, HashMap, and an Array to process the lyrics and count word frequencies. These data structures were the easiest to implement and use. I used the array first as a delimiter to store each word in an index after every space. Then I used a HashMap, I used the words as a key and the counter as a value.Then I used a LinkedHashMap to sort the map by its value.If I had more time on the project, I would do a deeper analysis on why the repetitiveness of the song was a hit. As well as the financial impact the song had on the Gucci brand.
      
<h1>Song choice and its visualization?</h1> </p>
    
    <p>The reason I chose Gucci Gang is because of its repetition. I always wondered why the song became a hit, peaking at number 3 on the billboard hot 100. I chose this data visualization technique because of how eligible it is to represent the number of times a word appears within a song, instead of using numbers. </p>
    <h1>Music By The Numbers</h1>
    <p>The song sold 5 million records, if I were to divide the cost of each word it would be 5,000,000/366 = 13661.20 records sold per word.Obviously, the top word/phrase of the song is Gucci Gang which was repeteated 50 times, with a total of 365 words. No, it was not a surprise that was the most used word within the song.</p>
